# YelpCamp
FullStack Web Dev Project I used in learning Web Technologies. 
It is commented with reminders and desicriptions. I find in my case, I 
understand more and learn faster using more practical approaches.
I would rather dive in building an application and leave notes 
and comments as I go. If you happen to come accross this and you are 
learning like me, here you go :)

There will be another file on

** MIDDLEWARE ***************************
********************************************
-----An express app is basically a series of middleware function calls----

Express Middleware- functions which run during request/response lifecycle
-Each function has access to request and response objects
-Each function can end HTTP request by sending back a response
-Can chain middleware
-Can execute any code

Will use Morgan aswell as built-in express middleware
